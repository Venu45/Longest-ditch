Bob recently took up some construction work for the Department of Road and Transportation. He had to fill up N number of roadside ditches. He filled a ditch from distance ’l’ to ’r’ everyday.

Now after completing his contract, he is interested in finding out the longest segment of the ditch that was filled by him. Your goal is to find the length of the longest segment that was filled.

Note: Define a structure called Segment which contains two integers start(l) and end(r). It is compulsory to use the structure to store the input segments.

typedef struct Segment{
    int start;
    int end;
  } Segment;
Input Format

The first line of input contains an integer N representing the number of segments of ditches. The next N lines of the input consists of two integers l and r which denote the start and end of the ditch (l, r included)

Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 100000

1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 100000

Output Format

Print a single integer denoting the length of the maximum segment

Explanation 10

The input segments [1,5] [2,8] [9,15] [16,16] result in one segment [1,16]. The length of this would be 16.

Explanation 11

The segments formed are [1,15] [22,30] [54,67] [98,105] [124,137] [150,160] [170,177] [180,190]. So the largest segment here is [1,15] with length 15.
